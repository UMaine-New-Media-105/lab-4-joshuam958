With this project I worked on making my own unctions for shapes and sprites. I made 2 of my own sprites, one is a Alien, and one is a Diamond. The Alien is the main sprite on the code, but when the mouse is pressed the diamond will show up over it. I enjoy how both of these sprites turned out, and I fell that I have a good understanding on hpw to create and use functions.
